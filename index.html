                Ibhan Aggarwal is a first-year Computer Science major who is extremely interested in educational technology.
                In high school, he created a web application that allowed young students to practice musical notes and scales,
                which ended up being used in local middle school band classes. Furthermore, he is currently working on a project
                to improve American Sign Language education with the organization Big Data Big Impact. He hopes to continue producing
                similar work with more advanced skills through the Bits of Good bootcamp.
